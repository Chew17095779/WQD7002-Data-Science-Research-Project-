**Abstract:**

Previous study found that American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR) risk stratification was the only protocol which has a significant relationship with simple complications when examining various established cardiac risk stratification like AACVPR, ACSM, AHA, SSC etc., on predicting the occurrence of simple complications during the cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program. In this context, AACVPR risk stratification is important indicator to guide clinicians to develop CR plan to cardiac patients. Despite the vital role of the AACVPR risk stratification in CRP, there are no research conducted on predicting AACVPR risk level for CRP. 

This study seeks to explore potential factors affecting the AACVPR risk stratification which served the purpose of providing support to clinicians to assign suitable Cardiac Rehabilitation treatment path to cardiac patients. Predictive models were developed to predict the AACVR risk level of cardiac patients using a combination of feature selection techniques and machine learning techniques as well as deep learning methods. The performance of models was then assessed using accuracy and compared with the results obtained by previous study (Lofaro, et al., 2016). Results indicated that LASSO regression outperformed all the other ML and DL algorithms by achieving an accuracy of more than 86.24% across all variations of datasets and in the meanwhile, no algorithm except LASSO can achieve an accuracy of higher than 65%.
Future studies can focus on predicting different risk stratification protocols such as risk protocol developed by American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), American Heart Association (AHA), PASHKOW etc and compare them using various performance metrics. The small size of dataset and poor data quality may be reported as one of the potential limitations.
